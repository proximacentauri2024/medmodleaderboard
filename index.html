<p>Clinical practice involves the analysis of information from multiple sources to make informed decisions about the patient&#39;s state. Recently, multimodal machine learning has provided new opportunities to developing models that integrate multiple modalities, mimicking clinical practice. However, multimodal benchmarks involving routine modalities, specifically Electronic Health Records (EHR) and Chest X-ray images (CXR), are scarce. </p>
<p>To help advance multimodal learning in tackling real-world prediction tasks, we present <strong>MedMod</strong> with the following contributions:</p>

<ul>
    <li>We propose a diverse and comprehensive multimodal clinical benchmark comprising six clinical prediction tasks using two publicly available datasets <a href="https://physionet.org/content/mimiciv/2.2/">MIMIC-IV</a> and <a href="https://physionet.org/content/mimic-cxr-jpg/2.1.0/">MIMIC-CXR</a>: prediction of clinical conditions, in-hospital mortality, decompensation, length of stay, readmission, and radiological findings. </li>
    <li>We perform extensive evaluations of six supervised learning models, encompassing basic fusion paradigms (early, joint, late) and other sophisticated multimodal frameworks. </li>
    <li>We also evaluate three state-of-the-art self-supervised learning methods and present a unified evaluation scheme and protocol for each task. </li>
</ul>
